# VideoGameCollection
Get ready to track your gaming valuables with ease! Game Collect is a in-development iOS application project that allows collectors to manage their prized video game collectibles such as games, merchandise, cheat books, and more! Here you have all different points of functionality in the app such as:
- Display and organize your favorite games
- Use your iPhone/iPad camera to scan barcodes to add new games and items
- Search for new recommended games and view screenshots, trailers, and game ratings information
- Change your mind and want to delete your data? No problem! Privacy is paramount, which is why this app uses Apple CloudKit for user data storage. Simply delete your information in the settings screen. No complicated forms or emails to write out.
